[Tenseg LLC](https://www.tenseg.net) specializes in technology consulting for libraries, non-profits, and creative endeavors. Our experience is primarily with WordPress development and site maintenance, although we've begun branching into Statamic. But we love a challenge, so feel free to press us beyond these boundaries.

We want to give back to the communities that we are a part of, and so some of the code we write we put out here for all to use. The majority of our current work found here surrounds WordPress, largely in custom plugins that began when a client asked for a feature and we realized others may benefit from it as well. There are also some oher projects here that are not related to client (or even WP) work.

If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to reach us at [dev@tenseg.net](mailto:dev@tenseg.net).
